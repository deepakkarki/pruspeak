#PRU Speak encoding

> NOTE : The short forms used in this encoding doc are as follows :

>         C : constant (value is the constant specified)

>         V : variable (value is the address where variable V is located)

>         Arr[C] => V (since, the final value is address(Arr) + C, viz a variable). 
  Note that V will be used instead of Arr[C] throughout the document.
  
>         Arr[V] : array indexed by variable V

(I should probably write how the variable stuff work here...
and also how the doc is structured)

##1. SET instruction
The SET instruction is of the form 

```
SET x, y
```
where **x** (operand-1) can be either **V or Arr[v]** whereas **y** (operand-2) can be either **C, V, Arr[v]**.

The general function of this instruction is to set variable values.
(In some cases it is also used to create variables)

There are many possible ways a **SET** instruction can be used based on how we choose **x** and **y**
There are three possible opcodes (as given below) that handle all conditions of x, y.

> OPCODE used : 0x10 (16) to 0x12 (18)

###1.a ```SET V, C```

This is a 32 bit instruction. This instruction is the case when operand-1 is a **V or A[c]** and opernad-2 is a **constant (max 16 bit)**. 

**opcode** 

```c
0x10 (16)
```

**operation**
```
Sets the value of variable V to the 16 bit int value C.
If V has not been previously defined, it creates and assigns.
```

**encoding format** (each value separated by a comma takes one byte)
```c
OPCODE, VARIABLE, CONST-hi, CONST-lo

Byte3 : 0001-0000 : (OPCODE - Fixed)
Byte2 : VARIABLE  : (address of the variable V)
Byte1 : CONST-hi  : (MS-byte of constant C)
Byte0 : CONST-lo  : (LS-byte of constant C)

```

**Example**
```

```

###1.b ```SET V1, V2```

This is a 32 bit instruction. This instruction is the case when operand-1 and operand-2 are either **V** (or Arr[c]) 

**opcode** 

```c
0x11 (17)
```

**operation**
```
Sets the value of variable V1 to the value of variable V2.
If V1 has not been previously defined, it creates and assigns.
(give some more explanation? or put that in the examples? - I think in example is better)
```

**encoding format** (each value separated by a comma takes one byte)
```c
OPCODE, VARIABLE, unused, VARIABLE

Byte3 : OPCODE    : 0001-0001   (OPCODE - Fixed)
Byte2 : VARIABLE  : (address of the variable V1)
Byte1 : unused    : (unused)
Byte0 : VARIABLE  : (address of the variable V2)

```

**Example**
```
coming soon :)
```

###1.c ```SET x, y```

This is a **64 bit** instruction. This instruction is the case when either **x** (operand-1) or **y** (operand-2) 
is of the form **Arr[v]**.

The possible forms of instructions :
```
SET V1, Arr[V2]
SET Arr[V], 280
SET Arr[V1], V2
SET Arr[V1], Arr[V2]
```

**opcode** 

```c
0x12 (18)
```

**operation**
```
Sets the value of variable "x" to the value of "y"
If "x" is a variable (not Arr[v]) and has not been previously defined, it creates and assigns.
If "x" is of type Arr[v], and Arr has not been defined, it is an error.
```

**encoding format** (each value separated by a comma takes one byte)
```

(add a simple example here)
```

**Example**

##2. SET RES[] instruction

This instruction is of the form 
```
SET RES[x], y
```
Where **RES** is a reserved array variable such as **DIO, PWM, COM, TMR, AIO**;

**x** can be either **C or V** where as **y** (operand-2) can be either **C, V, Arr[v]**.

This behaves like a regular SET instruction, but has been given special opcodes as :
  * These instruction use reserved arrays
  * They are used often, so giving exclusive byte code makes execution faster on the PRU
  * Normally these sort of instructions will take 64bits; whereas here all take only 32bits

Hence these inst are not compiled as a part of normal **SET** instruction.

> OPCODE used : 0x01 (1) to 0xFF (15)

###2.a ```SET DIO[x], y```

This is a 32 bit instruction. Here **x** and **y** can be either a Constant (C) or Vriable(V).

Note : actual value of OP1 and OP2 will depend on type of "x" and "y".
       and the type information is encoded in OP_type as given below.
       
OP_type (making sense of the 8 bits)

0 0 00-0000
| | \     /
x y  unused

  bit 7 - type of "x"
  bit 6 - type of "y"

> Just like DIO & PWM, the above mentioned instructions have 3 opcodes for each of the following instruction type
  * SET RES[C], C/V
  * SET RES[C], Arr[V]
  * SET RES[V], Arr[V]
  
**Only** things that change are the **operation** and **OPCODE**. (encoding and examples are more or less the same)

##3. IF instruction

This instruction is of the form 
```
IF ( x <cond> y ) GOTO z
```
Where **x** (first operand), **y** (second operand), **z** (third operand) can be any of C, V, Arr[V].
Here <cond> is a relational operator such as '>', '<', '==', '!=' etc.

There is no different cases for this instruction, rather one **64 bit** instruction which handles all possible variable types internally. 

**opcode**
```python
The **OPCODE** starts from 0x20 (0b0010-0000) and ends at 0x2F (0b0010-1111).
How this works is this instruction reserves the "0b0010-xxxx" instruction space.
The last 4 bits takes its value based upon <cond>. The mapping is as shown below.

cond_code = {
				'=='	: 0b0000,
				'!='	: 0b0001,
				'>='	: 0b0010,
				'<='	: 0b0011,
				'>'	: 0b0100,
				'<'	: 0b0101
	}

```

**operation**
```
The comparision is carried out between "x" and "y", if the result is true, then the IP (inst pointer) jumps to the inst number specified by "x"
```

**encoding**
```
OPCODE, OP_type, OP1.b, OP1.a

Note : actual value of OP1 and OP2 will depend on type of "x" and "y".
       and the type information is encoded in OP_type as given below.

##4. WAIT instruction
This instruction is of the form 
```

instruction if millis + micros argument is given.

**opcode**
```c
0x14 (20)  for WAIT 100
0x17 (23)  for WAIT 100.345
```
**operation**
```
Executing this command will pause the execution of the running script for 
"x" mili seconds. (The wait is non blocking - more about this later)
```
**encoding**
```
OPCODE, OP_type, OP.b, OP.a

since the operand can be any of three types, the OP_type will tell us the 
type of "x" in the instruction.

The OP_type is encoded as follows

00  00 - 0000
\/  \       /
x    unused

bit value to type of OP ("x") mapping :
00 => OP is of type 'C'
  OP.a = Const

01 => OP is of type 'V'
  OP.a = VARIABLE

```
**operation**
```
Executing this command will cause the IP (instruction pointer) to jump to instruction number "x"
```
**encoding**
```
OPCODE, OP_type, OP.b, OP.a

since the operand can be any of three types, the OP_type will tell us the 
type of "x" in the instruction.

The OP_type is encoded as follows

##7. ARITHMETIC and BIT instructions
This instruction is of the form 
```
INS x, y
```
where **INS** is a arithmetic or bitwise operation command;
**x** (operand1) and **y** (operand2) can be of type **C or V or Arr[v]**

There are **32 bit** and **64 bit** variations for each instruction.

**opcode**
> Each **INST** uses 2 opcodes (one for 32 bit encoding, another for 64 bit) based on what the **x**, **y** values are. 
  opcode starts from 48 (0011-0000), ends at 79 (0100-1111). Bit excoding is done based on this 
  map containing **INST** to the LS nibble value of the corresponding OPCODE.
  ```python
  opcode_dict = {
		#These inst own the (0011-XXXX) address space
					'ADD'	: 48,
					'SUB'	: 50,
					'MUL'	: 52,
					'DIV'	: 54, 
					'MOD'	: 56,

###7.a ADD V, y

This is a 32 bit instruction where **y** can be a variable or constant.

**opcode**
```c

```

**encoding**

Byte1 : VARIABLE  : (the address of variable V)
Byte0 : OP        : (reserved for operator 1, actual value depends on OP_decider)

since the operand can be C or V, the OP_type will tell us the type of "y" in the instruction.
The OP_type (8bits) is encoded as follows :
1000 - 0000

##9. ABORT, DEBUG, RUN, (END)SCRIPT instructions

These instructions are known as **control instructions**. They are not run on the PRU, rather are interpreted on the Linux side. (userspace python lib for now, may later be moved to the kernel)

**opcode**
```c
None - it is not compiled, 
rather the compiler framework itself interprets the cmd and does the needful.
```

**operation**
```
ABORT	: kills the current script, all variables and arrays defined are freed.
DEBUG	: streams the PRU Speak variables and state to the userspace. 
SCRIPT	: marks the starting of a script.
ENDSCRIPT : marks the ending of a script.
RUN	: runs the most recently defined script.
```
